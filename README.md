## React Radio Map

I'm goin to map a radio map using React with Google maps api and Dirble's api services!  
The idea is user can see lots of tiny marker wchich indicates different radio station on this planet(Am I allien?),  
and can listen to it by click on the tiny marker, and it may pop up some informations...
IDK... I'll figure it out later...

### Todo List

- ✅ Get all the country that available via Dirble api (which current stored in my json file to save request times).
- ✅ Implement Google map.
- ✅ Create country selector with filter function, and can take user to the country they want.
- ❎ Display station on the map with marker.
- ❎ Implement click to listen function.
- ❎ Implement basic player functions.
- ❎ Show station info on some kind of panel or info window...?

LCTOAN.
